# tumors_prediction
This is an University project for: Biología Matemática. 

It is a replication and analysis in python of 'Classical Mathematical Models for Description and Prediction of Experimental Tumor Growth' by Sébastien Benzekry. 
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003800

In the document G5_Asensi_Garcia_Ortega_texto.pdf you will find the complete analysis of the project. 

All documents and data can be found in https://github.com/cristinavaghi/plumky#python-packages

Main sections of the project: 
- Analysis of the mathematical models. (anexo 1)
- Adjustment and estimation of parameters based on experimental data. (anexo 2)
- Assessing the accuracy of our models. (AIC, RMSE, p-value...) (anexo 3)
- Descriptive power and predictive power of our models.  (anexo 4 and anexo 5)

Some of the original data (PLUMKY) were modified and you can find them in the data_modified file. 
However, it is highly recomended to read G5_Asensi_Garcia_Ortega_tecto.pdf
